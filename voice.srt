00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:05,237
Liam, a passionate runner, faced the same invisible wall every single run.

2
00:00:05,187 --> 00:00:11,262
At the 3-mile mark, his legs would ache, his breath would falter, and he'd give up, walking the rest.

3
00:00:11,262 --> 00:00:14,962
Frustrated, he decided to try something radical.

4
00:00:14,962 --> 00:00:21,112
Instead of focusing on the distance, he focused purely on his breathing, one steady rhythm at a time.

5
00:00:21,112 --> 00:00:25,350
He stopped looking at his watch, just felt his feet on the pavement.

6
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,050
The 3-mile mark came and went.

7
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:30,250
He didn't even notice.

8
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:33,612
Suddenly, his app buzzed: 4 miles!

9
00:00:33,612 --> 00:00:38,337
He'd shattered his barrier, not with stronger legs, but a stronger mind.

10
00:00:38,337 --> 00:00:41,812
The wall was never physical; it was in his head.

11
00:00:41,812 --> 00:00:44,887
Every limitation we face often is.
